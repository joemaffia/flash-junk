						Question 63 - 65<br/>200 miles from the North Pole
					</b>
					<br/>Dave Mill is on a 500-mile walk so this is no ordinary journey. He is trying to walk to the North Pole from Canada. He is the first person to try to walk alone and completely unaided; no planes will drop him extra supplies. He is 33 and from Perth in Scotland. He left Ward Hunt Island, Canada, on April 12, carrying all his food and equipment on a sledge. At this time of the year temperatures can fluctuate from -8C to as low as -18C. He knows this is a very difficult challenge he has set himself but he won't give up easily. On Tuesday, for example, he walked 16km in storms and he fell through ice up to his knees while wearing skis.<br/>
					He has completed about two-thirds of his trek so he is about 200 miles from the North Pole but for the last four days he has been confined to his temporary camp by fierce Arctic storms with winds of up to 60mph. Visibility is minimal so it is very difficult for him to navigate across the last part of his journey. In addition, the ice is breaking up and separating from the stable ice. This means that he may find areas of clear water between him and his final destination.<br/>
					The organizers of the expedition say they may have to rescue him if he cannot continue to the North Pole.  Of course, they hope this will not happen but they explain that there are limits. The organizers keep in touch with Dave via satellite phone. As soon as Dave says he can go no further, they have a plan to get him out. His family fully support him in his adventure and say they are proud of him whether he finishes the journey or not.

						Question 66 - 70 <br/> New graduate - new job
					</b>
					Summer turns most people's thoughts to holidays, but those leaving university or school will be thinking about the big, wide world of work. Whatever job you decide to tackle first, it will prove to be a valuable training ground. Filing or typing memos may not be your idea of a great career move, but be prepared to learn these lowly tasks. You may have a top degree, but no boss will hire you if you can't answer the telephone in a proper manner.<br/><br/>
					Most graduates and school leavers will be coming into the employment market in the summer, so competition will be tough. Start searching sooner rather than later. You should highlight any work experience you have and say you are keen to learn. It also helps to research the firms and what the job involves. Remember that most junior hiring decisions are made on personality. Firms are looking for reliable, conscientious and punctual employees. While most employers want junior staff to take the initiative and be receptive to their ideas, you must be realistic about time-frames for promotion. And even if you end up spending your career doing something other than your first job, bear in mind that you will learn very useful and often transferable skills in the process.<br/><br/>
					Aim to be hired by the firm that has the best reputation for employee training. At the interview you should ask about what sort of experience you will gain. The faster you can pick up the experience, the faster you can move up the corporate ladder. A good company will start you in a 'proper' job, which is mixed with technical and personal training. As well as learning computer and other professional skills, good firms also offer training which focuses on interaction with colleagues. In many companies trainees are allotted a 'mentor', a senior member of staff - not their immediate boss - who they can consult on difficult areas. New employees are encouraged to socialize and network with other trainees, which is again another way of finding support and advice but this time through their peers. <br/><br/>
					In fact once installed in your new position, the first thing is to work out the pecking order. Many people try to deny it but office politics does exist. If you've never been in a work environment before, use your first job to learn about how to handle it or how to avoid it.
